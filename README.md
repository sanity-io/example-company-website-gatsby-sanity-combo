## Enable Gatsby watch mode for drafts

We have enabled the watch mode in the `gatsby-source-sanity` plugin. That means that means that your frontend will automatically update with content changes whenever you publish them. If you want the frontend to show content changes in real time, you must do the following:

* Go to [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io) and find your project (or run the command `sanity manage` in the studio folder)
* Navigate to Settings->API and scroll down to the **Tokens** section
* Add a new token and give it **read** privileges.
* Copy the `.env-example` file to a file called `.env` in the `/web` folder
* Add your new token to the key: `SANITY_TOKEN="<token here>"`

If you restart the local development server, it will now show unpublished changes from the Studio. Note that the `.env` file is ignored by Git, because the token gives access to unpublished content in the API.

## Usage example

This project demos Sanity.io with Gatsby using our [source plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-sanity). It's a good starter for a simple company site, a portfolio site for an agency or a personal blog with an attached portfolio.

We tried to strike a balance between a useful example and a minimal footprint to make it easier to iterate on design and content model. [Let us know](https://slack.sanity.io) should you have questions!

## Development setup

### Run it

```sh
npm start
# Studio at http://localhost:3000
# Web frontend at http://localhost:8000
# GraphiQL explorer at http://localhost:8000/___graphql
```




### Development workflow

We wrote a blog post about how to use this example, but if you would like to just start tinkering:

- The Sanity Studio keeps its schemas in `./studio/schemas`. We will hot reload the editor when you edit them so just start experimenting. [Read more about our schemas here](https://www.sanity.io/docs/content-studio/the-schema).
- We followed Gatsby conventions and [you can read all about them here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
- If you want Gatsby to not throw errors on missing fields for unpopulated data you need to redeploy the GraphQL API so we can generate schemas – `sanity graphql deploy`


## Deployment

```sh
# Deploy GraphQL to the Sanity API
npm run graphql-deploy

# Deploy the Sanity Studio to *.sanity.studio
npm run sanity-deploy

# Build & deploy to Zeit's Now
npm run now-deploy
```

> **Deploy on Netlify:** If you want to deploy the Gatsby site to Netlify we added a netlify.toml config for you.
>
> Fork or clone the example to your GitHub account. After adding your repo to Netlify you’ll get automatic builds & deploys when pushing to master. You can also add a [webhook](link-to-the-doc) to get deploys on content changes.
